==================
List Comprehension
==================

Can be a little hard to understand in the beginning but can be very handy.

A list comprehension is basically a one line for loop that produces a Python **list** data structure.
Here's a simple example,
`>>> x = [i for i in range(0, 10)]`

List comprehension used as a filter,
`>>> if [i for i in line if "SOME TERM" n i]:
        "Do something"`
